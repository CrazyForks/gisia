    ## Managing Issues with Board

    ### Show Issues on Board
    - Label an issue with workflow labels (`workflow::todo`, `workflow::working_on`) to display it on the project board
    - Only issues with these workflow labels appear in the board columns

    ### Filter Issues
    - Click the gear icon ⚙️ on any column to filter issues
    - Apply additional labels (like `sprint::1`) to narrow down what's displayed
    - Multiple filters work together to show only matching issues
